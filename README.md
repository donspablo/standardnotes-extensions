## Standard Notes Extensions - Self-Hosted Repository
You can host standard Notes extensions on your own server. This application parses the majority of open-source extensions available from the Standard Notes team, as well as a variety of extensions created by the larger Standard Notes community, in order to generate an extensions repository that can be immediately inserted into Standard Notes Web and Desktop Clients. (https://standardnotes.org/)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/149639579-a0e825b7-a549-48e3-8082-95590f84640f.png)

Extensions are listed as `YAML` in the `/extensions` sub-directory, pull a request if you'd like to add yours.

### Docker

* To run this repository via Docker, clone it, build your '.env' file using the given 'env.sample', and optionally add any additional extensions to the '/extensions' directory, as described above.
* Then pull and start the container, specifying mount points for the '.env' file, the 'extensions' directory, and the 'public' directory, which will include the self-hosted extensions:
```bash
$ docker run \
  -v $PWD/.env:/build/.env \
  -v $PWD/extensions:/build/extensions \
  -v $PWD/public:/build/public \
  -v $PWD/standardnotes-extensions-list.txt:/build/standardnotes-extensions-list.txt \
  iganesh/standardnotes-extensions
```

#### Docker Compose

Although the exact configuration for using the container with docker-compose will be somewhat specific to your configuration, the following snippet may be useful, assuming that you have already cloned this repository into your '$HOME' directory and followed the instructions regarding creating the '.env' file and creating a directory called '/extensions':

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
  nginx:
  ...
    volumes:
    - standardnotes-extensions:/usr/share/nginx/html

  standardnotes-extensions:
    image: iganesh/standardnotes-extensions
    restart: "no"
    volumes:
      - $HOME/standardnotes-extensions/.env:/build/.env
      - $HOME/standardnotes-extensions/extensions:/build/extensions
      - $HOME/standardnotes-extensions/standardnotes-extensions-list.txt:/build/standardnotes-extensions-list.txt
      - standardnotes-extensions:/build/public

volumes:
  standardnotes-extensions:
    name: standardnotes-extensions
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/149639641-e7c70779-04ef-47ba-b78c-79fb358a411e.png)

As demonstrated in the instructions below, this snippet will manage the extension creation container's construction and store the result in the "standardnotes-extensions" volume, which can subsequently be mounted in the nginx container for service. Keep in mind that the "restart: "no"" flag is essential since the container is expected to terminate after completing the extension creation process and so must be included.

Additionally, please keep in mind that the configuration snippet above is far from complete: you will still need to configure the Nginx container and start the synchronizing server containers after completing the above configuration.

Docker Build is a tool that enables you to create a container on the hard drive of your computer.

You can construct the container using the following command: Clone this repository, navigate to it using the "cd" command, and execute the following command:

```bash
$ docker build --no-cache -t standardnotes-extensions:local .
```

### Setup with nginx

```nginx
	location ^~ /extensions {

		   #
		   # Custom headers and headers various browsers *should* be OK with but aren't
		   #
		   add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range,X-Application-Version,X-SNJS-Version';

		   add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
		   add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
		   return 204;

Add https://kyleburke.net/standard-notes-open-extended or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylejbrk/standard-notes-open-extended/gh-pages/index.json as your Extended Activation Code, and click **Submit Code**. 

_Note this currently can only be activated on the Desktop Application_

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Standard Notes Extension Repository Activation" src="https://github.com/kylejbrk/standard-notes-open-extended/blob/master/assets/activation.png?raw=true" width="80%" />
</p>
The following steps must be completed: - Create a fork of the repository; - Generate the action using the build files (this may necessitate removing and re-creating the.github/workflows folder). - Assign your github page to the gh-pages branch on github's master branch.

In the Extended Activation Code field, replace 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR USERNAME HERE/standard-notes-open-extended/gh-pages/index.json' with "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR USERNAME HERE/standard-notes-open-extended/gh-pages/index.json" _Optional_ Assign your endpoint to the environment variable CUSTOM DOMAIN if you're using a custom domain instead of the default.

Use ```https://standardnotes-extensions.netlify.app/index.json``` as an *Extended Code* in Standard-Notes.

### Option 2: Fork & Use custom URL (with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/))

1. Fork this repo [benjaminjacobreji/standardnotes-extensions](https://github.com/benjaminjacobreji/standardnotes-extensions/fork)

2. Sign-in/ Sign-up into [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)

3. Click on [New site from Git](https://app.netlify.com/start) Button.

4. Connect to GitHub and select forked repo  ```your-github-username/standardnotes-extensions```

5. Deploy site and wait for build to finish

6. (Optional) Change Site name at ```Site settings > Change site name``` on Netlify

7. After that you can use ```YOUR_SITE_URL/index.json``` as an ```Extended Code```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/149639683-5ebe0495-ed4d-42da-8e08-e2e712eff9bf.png)

### Option 3: Fork & Use custom URL (without [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/))

It's easy and recommended to host with Netlify. However if you insist not to use it, it is also possible (notice: the following steps work on Linux or WSL):

1. Before you begin, ensure that your environment contains both 'Python 3.7' and 'Git'.

2. Confirm that the command 'python' may be used to access Python 3.7 directly from the shell.

3. Verify that Git is installed and accessible using the shell command 'git'.

4. Execute 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the required Python libraries.

5. Begin the build script by typing 'URL=my url' in the command line and supplying the whole URL to the location of the resource files later. If you want to access the plugins via 'https://example.com/index.json', then change the value of'my url' with 'https://example.com/index.json'.

6. Confirm that the 'public' directory has been created; that a file entitled 'public/index.json' has information about all extensions; that all extensions exist as sub-directories in the 'public' directory; and that the 'public' directory contains all extensions.

7. Host the 'public' directory in the same manner as you would any other static resource, such as nginx, caddy, or any other comparable service.

8. To ensure that your reverse proxy (nginx, caddy, or traefik) functions properly, you must enable CORS headers. The following rules will sufficient when using nginx:
"'nginx add header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*'; add header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'content-type'; "'nginx add header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'content-type';
